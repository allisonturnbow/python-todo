# Python To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project is a Python-based to-do list application designed to practice core software development concepts, including data structures, file persistence, and user interaction. The application currently includes a fully functional command-line interface (CLI) and an in-progress graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

The goal of this project was to independently design and implement a small but complete application while focusing on clean structure and incremental feature development.

## Features
- Add, update, view, and delete tasks  
- Store tasks persistently using a JSON file  
- Command-line interface for basic interaction  
- Graphical user interface (Tkinter) for improved usability  
- Modular design separating logic, UI, and data handling

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- JSON (file persistence)
